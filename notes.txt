1. Making default theme as 'black' and extending it for the app
2. Creating the AuthPage with Chakra UI elements such as VStack, Box, Flex, etc.
3. Creating components, starting with AuthForm, followed by UseState to create an option for creating a new account in the same page. All of this is done within a React fragment
